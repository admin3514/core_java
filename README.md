‚úÖ **What is Java?** <br>
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is widely used to build web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more. <br>

Java‚Äôs tagline is ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that Java code written on one platform can run on any other platform that supports Java without needing to be recompiled.

‚úÖ **Key Features of Java**
```ssh

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Simple                 | Easy to learn, syntax similar to C/C++                                      |
|   Object-Oriented        | Based on real-world objects and concepts like inheritance and polymorphism  |
|   Platform Independent   | Java code runs on any OS using JVM (Java Virtual Machine)                   |
|   Secure                 | Provides runtime checking and no pointer manipulation                       |
|   Robust                 | Strong memory management and exception handling                             |
|   Multithreaded          | Supports concurrent execution of two or more threads                        |
|   High Performance       | Bytecode is optimized and executed by the JVM                               |
|   Distributed            | Supports distributed computing via networking packages (e.g., RMI, sockets) |
|   Portable               | Java programs can be moved easily from one system to another                |

‚úÖ **Java Architecture** <br> 
 1. Java Source Code (.java) ‚Üí Written by the programmer  <br>
 2. Compiler (javac) ‚Üí Converts source code to bytecode (.class) <br>
 3. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ‚Üí Executes the bytecode on any platform <br>

<hr>

‚úÖ **Components of Java** <br>

![Alt text](JDK-JRE-JVM.webp) <br>

```ssh
JDK = JRE + development tools
JRE = JVM + libraries
JVM = runs the code
```

üîπ *JDK (Java Development Kit)* <br>
  **What it is :** The full toolkit for Java developers. <br>
  **Function :** Lets you write, compile, and run Java code. <br>

üîπ *JRE (Java Runtime Environment)* <br>
  **What it is :** The runtime needed to run Java applications. <br>
  **Function :** Runs already compiled Java programs (you can‚Äôt compile Java code with just the JRE). <br>

üîπ *JVM (Java Virtual Machine)* <br>
  **What it is :** A virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. <br>
  **Function :** It interprets or compiles .class files (bytecode) into machine code for your specific OS and hardware. <br>
  
<hr>

‚úÖ **1. OOPs Concepts (Object-Oriented Programming)**
‚û§ **Class:**
A class is a blueprint or template that defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of an object.
```ssh
class Car {
   String color;
   void drive() {
     System.out.println("Driving...");
   }
}
```

‚û§ **Object:**
An object is an instance of a class. It occupies memory and has state and behavior.
```ssh
Car myCar = new Car();
```

‚û§ **Inheritance:**
Allows one class (child) to inherit fields and methods from another class (parent).
```ssh
class Animal {
  void sound() { System.out.println("Animal Sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
```

‚û§ **Polymorphism:**
Means "many forms". A method behaves differently based on the context.
 - Compile-time: Method Overloading
 - Runtime: Method Overriding

‚û§ **Encapsulation:**
Hides internal data using private access and exposes via public methods (getters/setters).
```ssh
class Person {
  private int age;
  public void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
  public int getAge() { return age; }
}
```

‚û§ **Abstraction:**
Hides complex implementation details and shows only necessary parts using abstract classes or interfaces.

<hr>

‚úÖ **2. Data Types in Java** <br>
‚û§ **Primitive Types :**
int, float, char, double, byte, short, long, boolean
```ssh
int x = 10;
char c = 'A';
```

‚û§ **Non-Primitive Types :**
Arrays, Strings, Classes, Interfaces
```ssh
String name = "Java";
```

<hr>

‚úÖ **3. Control Statements**  <br>
‚û§ **Conditional :**  if, else, switch - decision making
```ssh
if (a > b) { System.out.println("A is greater"); }
```

‚û§ **Loops :**  for, while, do-while - to repeat code
```ssh
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

‚û§ **Jumping :**  break, continue, return
```ssh
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) break;
}
```

<hr>

‚úÖ **4. Access Modifiers**  <br>
Control visibility of classes and members:
```ssh
| Modifier    | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| private     | ‚úÖ    | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå       | ‚ùå   |
| (default)   | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå       | ‚ùå   |
| protected   | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå   |
| public      | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ   |
```

<hr>

‚úÖ **5. Important Java Keywords**  <br>

*this*   - Refers to current object <br>
*super*  - Refers to parent class <br>
*final*  - Prevents change (variable), override (method), or inheritance (class) <br>
*static* - Belongs to class, not object <br>
*abstract* - Used to declare abstract class/method <br>
*synchronized* - Ensures thread safety <br>

<hr>

‚úÖ **6. Exception Handling**  <br>
‚û§ **What is an Exception?** <br>
An error that occurs at runtime and disrupts program flow.

‚û§ **Syntax:**
```ssh
try {
  int a = 5/0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
  System.out.println("Can't divide by zero");
} finally {
  System.out.println("Always executed");
}
```

*throw :* to throw a custom exception <br>
*throws :* declares exceptions in method signature <br>

<hr>

‚úÖ **7. Collections Framework**  <br>
Helps in storing, manipulating, and retrieving data efficiently.

```ssh
| Interface | Implementations                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| List      | ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector   |
| Set       | HashSet, TreeSet                |
| Map       | HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap |
```

‚û§ **Example:** <br>

```ssh
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple");
```

<hr>

‚úÖ **8. Multithreading** <br>
Allows concurrent execution of two or more threads (lightweight processes). <br>
‚û§ *Ways to create thread:* <br>
 - Extending Thread class
 - Implementing Runnable interface

```ssh
class MyThread extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Thread Running");
  }
}
```
‚û§ *Methods:*
 - start(), run(), sleep(), join(), wait(), notify()
